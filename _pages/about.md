I am an Assistant Professor (Tenure Track) in Economics at the University of Verona.  
My research focuses on the measurement and analysis of inequality and poverty, the
role of tax–benefit systems, the notion of the middle class, and the welfare of
households over time.

Alongside my position in Verona, I am a long-standing consultant with the
Poverty and Equity Global Practice at the World Bank, where I work on
distributional analysis, tax–benefit simulations, and the measurement of
poverty and inequality in both advanced and developing economies. I also
teach as an Adjunct Professor at Johns Hopkins SAIS Europe in Bologna and at
the University of Bologna.

I received my Ph.D. in Public Finance from the University of Pavia and a
degree in Economics and Social Sciences (110/110 magna cum laude) from
Bocconi University in Milan. Before joining the University of Verona, I was
on the faculty of Georgetown University’s Walsh School of Foreign Service in
Washington, DC, and worked for several years as an economist and consultant
at the World Bank.

Much of my work combines rigorous distributional methods with policy-relevant
questions: how we measure inequality and poverty, how tax and transfer
systems redistribute resources, and how concepts such as the “middle class”
should be defined and tracked across countries and over time. I have
published in journals such as *World Development*, *Review of Income and
Wealth*, *The Journal of Economic Inequality*, *Social Indicators Research*,
and *Journal of Development Studies*.

When I am not working with data or policy reports, I enjoy collaborating with
institutions and colleagues on projects that translate research into
accessible tools for policy makers, international organizations, and civil
society.
